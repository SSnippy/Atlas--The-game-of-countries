This is a game of atlas we all played during our childhood with out friends. The same rules applies, the current player says the name of
a country and the next player says the name of the country whose starting letter is the same as the lasst letter of the previous players.

this code uses pyttsx3 and speech recognition module to be able to play this game with sound rather than typing.
pyttsx3- is a module use by python to convert text to speech
speech recognition- is a module used by python to convert speech (input) to text which can then be used in the code.

it also uses random to play the game play non repetitive and time module to keep track of the play time.

this code however does not have a UI and runs in idle, as this was mainly made as a practice for being able to solve basic problems
that on encounters during the programming process.
